The November model was hopefully an improvement on the earlier one. 

I re-wrote the analysis for combining the multiple runs and reward vs. punishment categories.

I want to see how these new analyses run.


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, tidy=TRUE)
knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir="../")

```

```{r setup2, include=FALSE}
source("util/apply_local_settings.R")
apply_local_settings()
knitr::opts_chunk$set(cache.path = paste0(localsettings$data.dir,"knitrcache"))
source("nate_files/fitGroupsV3Onegroup.R")
source("data_summarize.R")
library(data.table)
library(ggplot2)
```



```{r model_run_prep, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE}
source("du_model_revised_2aa_4runs_mcmc_firstniterations.R")
```

So we want to compare:

What are the difference in alpha and beta estimate distributions for running a model with 4 runs rather than two?


```{r getDataIntoTable, echo=FALSE}
#arrange all the data into a single data table.
model.summary.all<-NULL

#iterations
miters<-unlist(lapply(model.summaries,function(m){
  return(length(m$summaryObj$iter))
}))
for(ms.i in 1:length(model.summaries)){
  #ms.i=2
  ms<-model.summaries[[ms.i]]
  ms.summaryObj<-ms$summaryObj
  ms.summaryObj$TestId<-ms.i
  ms.summaryObj$Group<-ms$g
  ms.summaryObj$ModelName<-ms$m
  ms.summaryObj$AnalysisRepetition<-ms$t
  ms.summaryObj$EstimationMethod<-ms$EstimationMethod
  #because when we ran this, we hadn't explicitly recorded estimation methods; 
  #but these are distinguishable by the number of iterations.
  if(is.null(model.summary.all)){
    model.summary.all<-ms.summaryObj
  }else{
    model.summary.all<-rbind(model.summary.all,ms.summaryObj,fill=TRUE)
  }
}
model.summary.all$EstimationMethod<-factor(model.summary.all$EstimationMethod)
```

We have a summary comprised of all values. Let's take a look at alpha and beta mu distributions in turn.
```{r AlphaBetaDistVisualize, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
source("visualization/geom_hdi.R")

m.mu<-model.summary.all[Statistic=="mu"]
#table(m.reward.mu.run1$ModelName)
#for clarity's sake...
m.mu$ModelName<-sub("double_update","DU",m.mu$ModelName)

  #plotly::ggplotly(p)
  ggplot(m.mu[Parameter=="alpha"],aes(x=Value,fill=factor(Group),color=factor(Group)))+
    geom_freqpoly(alpha=0.9,binwidth=0.001)+
     geom_hdi(size=2, lineend = "round",alpha=0.5,credible_mass=0.95)+
    facet_grid(ModelName~Run)+
    labs(title=paste0("mu statistic in reward and punishment rounds, alpha"))
   
  ggplot(m.mu[Parameter=="beta"],aes(x=Value,fill=factor(Group),color=factor(Group)))+
    geom_freqpoly(alpha=0.9,binwidth=0.001)+
     geom_hdi(size=2, lineend = "round",alpha=0.9,credible_mass=0.95)+
    facet_grid(ModelName~Run)+
    labs(title=paste0("mu statistic in reward and punishment rounds, beta"))

```


Let's go back and explore the original double update model values. This will show us a the "control" condition - what hte data should look something like. 


This is the simple one-run model:

```{r DoubleUpdateOneRunModel, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
source("visualization/geom_hdi.R")

m.onerunmodel<-model.summary.all[ModelName=="double_update_notrialpost"]
#table(m.reward.mu.run1$ModelName)
#for clarity's sake...
m.onerunmodel$ModelName<-sub("double_update","DU",m.onerunmodel$ModelName)

#plot alpha, beta mu and sigma by group.



  #plotly::ggplotly(p)
  ggplot(m.onerunmodel[Parameter=="alpha"],aes(x=Value,fill=factor(Group),color=factor(Group)))+
    geom_freqpoly(alpha=0.9,binwidth=0.001)+
     geom_hdi(size=2, lineend = "round",alpha=0.5,credible_mass=0.95)+
    facet_grid(Statistic~Run)+
    labs(title=paste0("mu, sigma statistic in reward and punishment rounds, alpha, one run model"))
   
  ggplot(m.onerunmodel[Parameter=="beta"],aes(x=Value,fill=factor(Group),color=factor(Group)))+
    geom_freqpoly(alpha=0.9,binwidth=0.001)+
     geom_hdi(size=2, lineend = "round",alpha=0.9,credible_mass=0.95)+
    facet_grid(Statistic~Run)+
    labs(title=paste0("mu, sigma statistic in reward and punishment rounds, beta, one run model"))

  
  
```

Very good. We only see overlap between groups, but that is OK - it may be that the groups in fact do not differ.

However it is useful to see the groups independent of one another.

The question here is: what do the within-run values look like? We'll focus on mu alpha values (not worry about their distributions for now)
and ask the question: What do they look like between runs?

```{r, echo=FALSE}
m.onerunmodel$RunMotivation<-paste0(m.onerunmodel$Run,m.onerunmodel$Motivation)
ggplot(m.onerunmodel[Parameter=="alpha" & Statistic=="mu"],aes(x=Value,fill=factor(RunMotivation),color=factor(RunMotivation)))+
    geom_freqpoly(alpha=0.9,binwidth=0.001)+
     geom_hdi(size=2, lineend = "round",alpha=0.5,credible_mass=0.95)+
    facet_grid(.~Group)+
    labs(title=paste0("mu, sigma statistic in reward and punishment rounds, alpha, one run model, by group"))
  

ggplot(m.onerunmodel[Parameter=="beta" & Statistic=="mu"],aes(x=Value,fill=factor(RunMotivation),color=factor(RunMotivation)))+
    geom_freqpoly(alpha=0.9,binwidth=0.001)+
     geom_hdi(size=2, lineend = "round",alpha=0.5,credible_mass=0.95)+
    facet_grid(.~Group)+
    labs(title=paste0("mu, sigma statistic in reward and punishment rounds, beta, one run model, by group"))
  


```

Because of shrinkage, there should actually be a little bit less difference between runs in the multiple-run version


```{r, echo=FALSE}
m.allrunmodel<-model.summary.all[ModelName=="double_update_nov_rev2-a-a"]
summary(m.allrunmodel$Motivation)
ggplot(m.allrunmodel[Parameter=="alpha" & Statistic=="mu"],aes(x=Value #,fill=factor(Run),color=factor(Run)
                                                               ))+
    geom_freqpoly(alpha=0.9,binwidth=0.001)+
     geom_hdi(size=2, lineend = "round",alpha=0.5,credible_mass=0.95)+
    facet_grid(.~Group)+
    labs(title=paste0("mu, sigma statistic (all rounds), alpha, variable number of runs model"))
  

ggplot(m.allrunmodel[Parameter=="beta" & Statistic=="mu"],aes(x=Value #,fill=factor(Run),color=factor(Run)
                                                              ))+
    geom_freqpoly(alpha=0.9,binwidth=0.001)+
     geom_hdi(size=2, lineend = "round",alpha=0.5,credible_mass=0.95)+
    facet_grid(.~Group)+
    labs(title=paste0("mu, sigma statistic (all rounds), beta, variable number of runs model"))

```

These are roughly in line with the other model, indicating that our models don't seem to be wildly diverging, a good sign.

But can we extract the per-run values?

As these are coded, reward runs are numbered as they are in the earlier model, and punishment runs are numbered two numbers up, i.e, Punishment Run 1 is numbered Run 3, and Punishment Run 4 is numbered Run 4.

There's no estimate taken from each run. This is because there's not really a reason to assume distribution across runs.

#Discussion 

We also can't distinguish between the two groups here.

Might be worth expanding this to look at group one; after that, though, I think we're done and need to expand the model.

Ideally we want to expand the model to take into account a systematic difference across *all* subjects between between reward and punishment trials.
