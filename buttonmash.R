  #what's the probability of exactly this sequence?
  #with binomial switches, we can reduce the information to simply a list describing the number of consecutive choices,
  #plus one bit describing which the first choice is.
  #but another way perhaps is....
  
  #probability is:
  changes<-changeDetect(choice_series)
  #now the probability of getting this given the parameter the multiplication across the entire series of p where there's a change of 1-p where there's no change.
  log(((p)^sum(changes))*((1-p)^sum(!changes)))

#optimize(log.dens.like.buttonmash,c(0.0,1),dr=data[[35]]$runs[[1]])
#but how do we get the group-level estimate to ignore button-mashers?
#We would need a subject-level parameter telling us that the data is from a button-masher and not to use it
