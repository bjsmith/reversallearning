Samples were drawn using NUTS(diag_e) at Mon Jun 25 11:54:36 2018.
For each parameter, n_eff is a crude measure of effective sample size,
and Rhat is the potential scale reduction factor on split chains (at 
convergence, Rhat=1).

Samples were drawn using NUTS(diag_e) at Mon Jun 25 11:55:21 2018.
For each parameter, n_eff is a crude measure of effective sample size,
and Rhat is the potential scale reduction factor on split chains (at 
convergence, Rhat=1).

Samples were drawn using NUTS(diag_e) at Mon Jun 25 11:55:34 2018.
For each parameter, n_eff is a crude measure of effective sample size,
and Rhat is the potential scale reduction factor on split chains (at 
convergence, Rhat=1).

Samples were drawn using NUTS(diag_e) at Mon Jun 25 11:56:30 2018.
For each parameter, n_eff is a crude measure of effective sample size,
and Rhat is the potential scale reduction factor on split chains (at 
convergence, Rhat=1).

Samples were drawn using NUTS(diag_e) at Mon Jun 25 11:57:14 2018.
For each parameter, n_eff is a crude measure of effective sample size,
and Rhat is the potential scale reduction factor on split chains (at 
convergence, Rhat=1).

Samples were drawn using NUTS(diag_e) at Mon Jun 25 11:57:28 2018.
For each parameter, n_eff is a crude measure of effective sample size,
and Rhat is the potential scale reduction factor on split chains (at 
convergence, Rhat=1).
