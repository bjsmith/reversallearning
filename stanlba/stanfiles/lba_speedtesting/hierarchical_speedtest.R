#we need to do a scientific test of the time taken to run the basic 3-level algorithm, applying:
#(1) vectorization shortcut
#(2) Phi_approx speedup
#(3) Non-centered parameterization

#this should:

#Run two stan models. OK to run sequentially. Print each model fit and gauge its efficiency. 
#Also time it although timing might not be a reliable indicator.
