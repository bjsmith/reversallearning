#this admended version of the dataset 
#(I) changes the group classification of several subjects whose risk is indeterminate.
#these are subjects who 
  # (1) had unprotected anal sex in the trial period, and
  # (2) had a primary partner, and
  # (3) who MAY not have had unprotected anal sex with anyone except their primary partner.
# (II)
## cleans up reaction times.
