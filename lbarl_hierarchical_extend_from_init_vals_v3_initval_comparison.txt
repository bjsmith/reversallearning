Samples were drawn using NUTS(diag_e) at Tue Jun 26 13:49:37 2018.
For each parameter, n_eff is a crude measure of effective sample size,
and Rhat is the potential scale reduction factor on split chains (at 
convergence, Rhat=1).

Samples were drawn using NUTS(diag_e) at Tue Jun 26 17:40:57 2018.
For each parameter, n_eff is a crude measure of effective sample size,
and Rhat is the potential scale reduction factor on split chains (at 
convergence, Rhat=1).
