This is a minimal example of the failure to recognize the align environment.

$$\text{log}(x)=y+z$$

Now here is a set of equations. They don't use the align environment.

$$
\text{ln}(x) =y+z \\
a =b+c
$$

But these ones do use the align environment:

$$\begin{aligned}
\text{ln}(x) & =y+z \\
a & =b+c
\end{aligned}$$
