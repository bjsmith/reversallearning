In summary, the behavioral data clearly demonstrates the relationship between raection time and correct responses, but only offers weak evidence that meth users perform poorly compared to non-meth users.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, cache=TRUE, include=FALSE}
library(R.matlab)
library(data.table)
library(ggplot2)
library('tidyr')

library(corrplot)

require(lme4)

```


```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE}
#put this in the right format
rl.all.subjects.dt<-data.table(rl.all.subjects.list)

#some helper functions.
fixedef.se<-function(fit){
  return(summary(fit)$coefficients[,"Std. Error"])
}

lm.beta.lmer <- function(mod) {
  b <- fixef(mod)[-1]
  sd.x <- apply(getME(mod,"X")[,-1],2,sd)
  sd.y <- sd(getME(mod,"y"))
  b*sd.x/sd.y
}

rl.all.subjects.list$reaction_time_adj<-rl.all.subjects.list$reaction_time
rl.all.subjects.list[is.na(reaction_time),reaction_time_adj:=1]
#table(is.na(rl.all.subjects.list$reaction_time))
#table(is.na(rl.all.subjects.list$reaction_time_adj))
rl.all.subjects.list.clean<-rl.all.subjects.list[score!=0]

```

After eliminating `r rl.all.subjects.list[score==0,.N]` non-response trials across the subjects, `r rl.all.subjects.list[score!=0,.N]` trials remain. 

```{r, echo=FALSE}


#what does reaction time look like in a distribution?

ggplot(rl.all.subjects.list.clean,aes(reaction_time,color=correct))+geom_density()+#facet_grid(SexRisk~.,margins=TRUE)
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(0.2,1.2,0.2))+
  labs(title="Reaction time density by outcome")
# ggplot(rl.all.subjects.list[score!=0],aes(reaction_time_adj,color=correct))+geom_density()+facet_grid(SexRisk~.,margins=TRUE)+
#   scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(0.2,1.2,0.2))+
#   labs(title="Reaction time density by outcome (color) and sexrisk (axis)")


```

Correct trials clearly are somewhat slower than incorrect trials, indicating that waiting, on average, paid off for participants.

There is some sign of a bimodal distribution for the incorrect trials. A small number of trials may be clustered around 0.4 s, and then a second set clustered around 0.62 s, just a few milliseconds below the peak of the correct trials at 0.65 s. \footnote{Should posit a bimodal distribution in a simple stan model and see if it does better than a unimodal model.}


I applied a logistic regression model to predict correct responses using reaction time, the position of each image in the segment, and the groups, presented as separate variables (MethUse and SexRisk), with subject ID as a random effect. \footnote{Really, runID also needs to be in here as a random effect, and actually, we need runid to be a random effect from 1 to 4}
```{r cache=TRUE}

mA2c<-glmer(correct~ 
                 #reaction_time+
                  presentation_n_in_segment+ #trial-level
                 #MethUse+
              SexRisk+(1|subid), #subject-level
               data = rl.all.subjects.list.clean,
            family = binomial, control=glmerControl(optimizer="Nelder_Mead"))
summary(mA2c)

mA2c.nomethuse.rt0<-glmer(correct~ 
                 reaction_time+presentation_n_in_segment+ #trial-level
                 SexRisk+(1|subid), #subject-level
               data = rl.all.subjects.list.clean,
               family = binomial, control=glmerControl(optimizer="Nelder_Mead"))
summary(mA2c.nomethuse.rt0)
```

```{r}
mA2c.rt0<-glmer(correct~ 
                 reaction_time+presentation_n_in_segment+ #trial-level
                 MethUse+SexRisk+(1|subid), #subject-level
               data = rl.all.subjects.list.clean,family = binomial, control=glmerControl(optimizer="Nelder_Mead"))
summary(mA2c.rt0)


lm.beta.lmer(mA2c.rt0)

```

The model clearly links reaction time with correct responses. We can calculate standardized $\beta$ values. The standardized beta for reaction time is 0.22 and the standardized beta for SexRisk, which also appeared significant, is 0.10.

```{r}

anova(mA2c,mA2c.nomethuse.rt0,mA2c.rt0)

```

An ANOVA comparison of the models offers unambiguous evidence with a strong difference in both AIC and BIC that adding reaction to the model improves its prediction of a correct response. However, the addition of MethUse as a predictor only improves AIC slightly, by 4 points, and the BIC, which more strongly peanlizes model complexity, suggests that the model including MethUse is not as powerful.
